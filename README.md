- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @amazonelope - I CREATED A PASSIVE MINTABLE PIECE OF ART USING BOTH 404 AND DIGITAL MATTER THEROY/ METAVERSE AND BITMAPS
- ðŸ‘€ I need to show you this, PIPE TEAM , Especiay MonteCrypto and Franklin
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter - @Amazonelope ; discord- @amazonelope

---PLEASE REVIEW AND GET BACK TO ME AS TO AN ADDRESS SO I CAN SEND YOU SOME AND SO THAT IT CAN BE AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE TEAM PROJECT USING THE SAME TECH AS BLOX AND 404
amazonelope/amazonelope is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears IN MY GitHub profile< AND ITS MY MOST RECENT PROJECT
 ðŸ‘€ NOTE THAT ALL OF THIS IS ON MY WEBSITE http://www.amazonelope.com
ðŸ‘€  NOTE THAT I NEED HELP TO GET THE WORD OUT< IF YOU THINK IT IS A WORTHY PROJECT
ðŸ‘€  NOTE THAT I AM CONVERTING ANY MONEY THAT COMES TO ME INTO CREATING A HIGH FLOOR PRICE FOR THE TREASURED PIPEBLOCKS
 ðŸ‘€ --THREE MOST IMPORTANT WAYS THAT I AM HELPING THIS PROJECT SUCCEED.
ðŸ‘€   1. I AM MAKING THE ART AND THE 3D rendering AND SETTING UP THE STAKING AND THE GAMING
ðŸ‘€    2. I AM NOT CHARGING VERY MUCH AT ALL BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THE LONG TERM SUCCESS AND I AM NOT ASKING THE TEAM FOR ANYTHING BUT THEIR EYES AND A BLESSING
 ðŸ‘€    3. I AM PERSONALLY TRYING THIS OUT MYSELF FOR A WEEK BEFORE I OFFICIALLY DROP IT!
ðŸ‘€  -- THREE THINGS THAT MUST HAPPEN FOR SUCCESS.
ðŸ‘€       1. PEOPLE NEED TO SEE THE DANG THING, WE NEED TO ADVERTISE! WE GOT BLOCKRUNNER AND ORDINALS REVOLUTION AND OUR OWN TWITTER X SPACES
 ðŸ‘€       2. DEEP DOWN INSIDE, MONTECRYPTO AND FRANKLIN NEED TO BELIEVE IN IT AND NOT JUST SEE IT AS AN AMATEUR MONEY SHILL
ðŸ‘€         3. WE NEED TO RELEASE IT IN CONJUNCTION WITH PEOPLE STAKING THEIR REGULAR PIPEBLOCKS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE UPCOMING BULL MARKET SO ASAP!
ðŸ‘€       -----WHAT AM I DOING NOW? IM GRADUALLY PREPARING TO RELEASE THE PROJECT ASAP UNDER THE SITE "INSCRIBE3 AND ALSO SATSx. I WANT IT ALL TO BE FLUID &PROFESSIONAL HELP ME!
